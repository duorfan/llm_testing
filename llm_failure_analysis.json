Ruby Yang - Hong Kong director won Best Documentary Short Subject for \"The Blood of Yingzhou District\" in 2007.\n3. Deng Kaige - Chinese film director produced \"Farewell My Concubine,\" a Chinese film that won award for Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nActors:\n1. Haing S. Ngor - Cambodian-American doctor and actor, born in Chinese-Cambodian descent, who won Best Supporting Actor for \"The Killing Fields\" in 1985.\n\nAlong with winners, there are also Chinese filmmakers and actors that were nominated for Oscars as well, such as film director Zhang Yimou, actor Jet Li, and actress Gong Li. While they have not yet won, they have made significant contributions to the film industry.\n\nPlease note that the number is smaller due to the language barrier, cultural differences, and other factors that might have rendered their films less accessible to the predominantly English-speaking Academy. However, in recent years with the growth of global cinema, more and more Chinese filmmakers and actors are making their mark in Hollywood.",
